# Instagram Following Watcher (Python)

This is a small Python project to keep a friendly eye on the followings of certain Instagram users.

## What it does
- Logs in to Instagram using **your provided login credentials**
- You give the **Instagram username** of the person you want to look at and the program searches for them
- Saves the **current following count**
- Tries to scrape the list of accounts that the target user **follows** (following list)

## Output
All collected data is saved into a **CSV file**.

## Notes / Limitations
⚠️ Instagram throttles requests and may stop showing the full list after a certain point, so you might not get every following entry.

If you know a reliable way to work around Instagram’s throttling (without breaking rules), feel free to share.

This project is for educational/personal use.
